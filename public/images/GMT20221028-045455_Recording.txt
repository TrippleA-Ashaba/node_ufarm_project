01:32:16	Emma Ilakut:	Hello Irene im settled now
01:34:03	Albert Ashaba Aheebwa:	@Irene { producetype: "dairy", status: "approved" } doesn't work
01:35:15	Zenah Tegulwa Zainab:	Try {producetype: 'dairy" && status: 'approved} and see
01:36:30	Fauzia Nakacwa:	Thanks Janz
01:36:39	Albert Ashaba Aheebwa:	@xhena no
01:37:36	Albert Ashaba Aheebwa:	probably the $match has some limitations
01:37:39	1 _Mukulembeze Wil:	Dr. Janz. Always grinding the hard stuff. Man do you ever tackle simple things.
01:37:58	Jansuk Emmanuel:	app.set('views', [path.join(__dirname, 'views'), path.join(__dirname, 'views/agricOfficer'), path.join(__dirname, 'views/urbanFarmer'), path.join(__dirname, 'views/farmerOne'),  path.join(__dirname, 'views/BoxSelections')])
01:38:52	Zenah Tegulwa Zainab:	I used it when I was passing the user's role and the their status and it worked, maybe passing params in the aggregation is different
01:39:09	Jansuk Emmanuel:	Inside the views i have other folders for agricOfficer, urbanFarmer etc where there pug files are found - then with that you can render straight forward
01:39:33	Albert Ashaba Aheebwa:	@Xhena did u use $match or $in?
01:39:44	1 _Mukulembeze Wil:	Great start Illakut. Good progress.
01:41:04	1 _Mukulembeze Wil:	Janz I thought of that but I imagined the needing to realign things as you've shown things need realigning but then now you've made it look simple again so kindly share what you are going to share with Fauz with me too.
01:41:33	Fauzia Nakacwa:	@ janz I also have folders, Am going to try it out
